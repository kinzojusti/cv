      <p><em>Software Engineer</em></p>
      <p>Ive spent the past 10 years in the commercial and residential real estate industry, before that I was in USMC as a Marine serving from May 2004 to December 2007 as an expeditionary air field recovery technician, training at the Naval Air Station
        Pensacola, then to Dover Air Station Delaware, once finished, I moved to NYC, NY.

        Within the time of working in real estate in NYC, I have been able to build experiences and bonds to travel the world as a entrepreneur, establishing myself in multiple fields of hospitalities and sales, through multiple mentorships in real
        estate, food & alcohol industry, gym and fitness industry, branching out to a short venture into the South Tampa Area of Florida.

        Upon moving back to NYC, I want a new career path which I would like to take in the direction of Software/ Web Development.
        Ive always had interest in IT/ Computer technology and a slew of different sciences, with interested in linguistics, the arts, graphic design, and music .

        I’d like to apply my real world experiences with the software engineering skills established and built at The FlatIron School.
        With that expand on my knowledge in programing as a full stack engineer, which in time will lead me to a lifetime of new experiences, with other fellow engineers and designers.

        I believe every job deserves a strong sense of professionalism, trustworthy support, creative
        thinking, and problem-solving. It doesn’t matter the task, these principles are my foundation for getting the job done right.

        I think outside the box and what can make things simple.

        As a software engineer I value integrity, willfulness, teamwork orientation, team-communication, team-solutions, always lifting others up.
        I’m excited to contribute my background to help in the tech industry, to build innovative technology that will connect others including businesses and platforms.
        <br>

        I’m currently working with: JavaScript, Next.JS, Node.js, React, React Native,Ruby, Rails
        <br>
        I have worked with: HTML, CSS, HTML5, GIT,Python, SCSS, SASS
